# Laser-Guard
Laser guard is a project that uses Arduino and laser to detect if someone is coming to the production line. When someone does walk in the laser will send a signal to the arduino which will send a signal to the generator. It uses Html, Css, PHP. This is the first version of this website and will be updated time to time to meet customer needs.
