# Laser-Guard
Laser guard is a project that uses Arduino and laser to detect if someone is coming to a production line. When someone does walk in the laser will send a signal to the arduino which will send a signal to the generator to stop make sure that a person does not get hurt on the production line. It uses Html, Css, PHP. This is the first version of this website and will be updated time to time to meet customer needs.
